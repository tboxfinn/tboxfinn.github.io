        Elysium was created with the purpose of simulating combinatorial strategies for variations of the 15-Puzzle problem whilst building a habit of utilizing effective modern C++.
        <br>
        <br>
        Elysium also marked my first effective solo usage of Trello for project management, it assisted me in keeping track of the requirements I had set to complete between time frames.
        <br>
        <br>
        The section of this project which I am most proud of is the template double ended stack and the template file readers & writers, all of which I utilise in my current C++ projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        A list of project features can be found in the repository linked above.

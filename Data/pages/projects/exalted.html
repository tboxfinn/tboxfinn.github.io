        Exalted was built from scratch with the goal of being an API agnostic high performance graphics engine as well as an education opportunity for deepening my own understanding of graphics architectures and the procedures surrounding the development of C++ systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        Exalted's architecture is based on Yan Chernikov's Hazel Engine. During the first semester of my MSc I expanded this project with a variety of features which allowed me to explore a wide range of rendering techniques, a list of which can be found in the github repository.
        <br>
        <br>
        The greatest challenge I experienced with Exalted was the development of different shadow mapping techniques, this was a direct result of my initial search for a "one version fits all" solution. I learned my lesson the hard way and ended up implementing a dynamic range of shadow mapping techniques in the process. I plan on attempting to implement variance shadow maps in the near future to see if they produce clearer results with dynamic scenes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Exalted currently only supports OpenGL rendering, however, the engine API is abstracted away allowing for easier extension into other APIs in the future.

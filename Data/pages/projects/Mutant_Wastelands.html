        Mutant Wastelands, originally named Buroni is a 3D rogue-like, survival game developed in Unity. The game was developed as a final project but was later expanded upon as a personal project. The game features a procedurally generated world, a day-night cycle, and a variety of enemies and weapons. The game was developed with the intention of being a fun and challenging experience for the player.

        The game's architecture is based on Sebastian Lagues procedural islands. As the project progressed I expanded the game with a variety of features which allowed me to explore a wide range of game development techniques, a list of which can be found in the github repository.

        The greatest challenge I experienced was the development of the procedural generation system and later, the implementatio of the multiplayer system. I learned a lot about the importance of planning and the importance of understanding the tools I was using. I plan on attempting to implement a more robust multiplayer system in the near future to see if I can improve the player experience.

        Mutant Wastelands currently only supports single player, however, Steamworks API is integrated allowing for easier extension into multiplayer in the future.

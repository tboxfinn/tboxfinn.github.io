    Worked on the development and implementations of deep neural nets to produce classification of a dynamic set of entities in dynamic environments, 
    including windy outdoor environments which had to be tracked during dynamic times of the day. 
    <br><br>
    This involved multiple projects and iteratively communicating with clients, using feedback in order to tailor solutions to their needs. 
    During this time I mostly worked with the following tools; Tensorflow, Python, C++ and the Qt framework.

    <br>
    Worked on algorithms which performed real-time motion detection in both new and existing security systems. 
    <br><br>
    During this time I was also able to gain experience in working with Qt, OpenCV, and C++, as I was required to integrate my solutions into client's Qt based applications.

    I was given the position of head mixologist for a sub-section of the bar, this involved managing a team of three to produce high quality cocktails and customer experiences.

    I was also involved in analyzing existing solutions in order to produce improved staff behavioural patterns combined with timed event executions, which successfully resulted in greater earnings from a customer base of over 1000 people per night.
